# Welcome to Codejutsu

## Mission Statement

This is a passion project of mine.

My primary goal is to address the skills gap that many computer science graduates from Pakistani universities face and provide them with the tools they need to excel in their job searches.

I aim to mentor graduates by providing:

- Rigorous practice in data structures and algorithms.
- Comprehensive CV workshops.
- Realistic mock interviews to boost interview preparedness.
- Tailored projects that enhance their skills, aligning them with their desired career paths.
- Effective guidance on collaborative project work, fostering teamwork and cooperation among team members.

## This Website

You may be wondering about the role of this website. It serves a dual purpose:

Firstly, it's here to inform recent graduates about CodeJutsu's mission, the benefits they can gain from our program, and how to get started on their journey with us.

Secondly, it acts as a platform to spotlight the skills and achievements of current engineers. We achieve this by providing links to their GitHub repositories and showcasing their projects, offering valuable insight to potential recruiters.

Down the line, if this project gains some traction, I will be cooking up more features, as I have plenty of ideas on how to take this project to the next level.

## Why the name CodeJutsu?

Naruto inspired, obviously!
